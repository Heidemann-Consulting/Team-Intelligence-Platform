# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Team Intelligence Platform (TIP) community pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences**
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
* **Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes**, and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community**
* **Supporting a collaborative approach** to problem-solving and innovation
* **Recognizing and valuing diverse contributions** from people with different skills and backgrounds
* **Practicing inclusive language** and being mindful of technical jargon that might exclude newcomers

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission

* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors
* Excessive self-promotion or recruitment without contributing to the community
* Disruptive behavior in community discussions, events, or online spaces

## Responsibility and Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* All code repositories, issue trackers, and wikis under the TIP GitHub organization
* Official TIP communication channels, including mailing lists, discussion forums, and chat platforms
* TIP events, virtual or in-person, including meetups, conferences, and workshops
* Any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the TIP community in public spaces.

## Enforcement Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [tip@heidemann-consulting.com](mailto:tip@heidemann-consulting.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

The TIP project team will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed to violate this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

### 4. Permanent Ban
