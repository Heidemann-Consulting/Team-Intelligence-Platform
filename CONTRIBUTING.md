# Contributing to Team Intelligence Platform (TIP)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Team Intelligence Platform! TIP is an open-source project designed to transform how product development teams integrate AI into their collaborative workflows, enabling AI to become a true team member rather than merely an individual productivity tool.

This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to TIP. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Introduction

The Team Intelligence Platform (TIP) is an innovative solution designed to transform how product development teams integrate AI into their collaborative workflows. Unlike traditional approaches where AI is used as an individual productivity tool, TIP enables "AI Co-Management" â€“ a paradigm where AI becomes an integrated team member contributing to collective intelligence.

TIP has a phased implementation framework:
1. **The Cognitive Foundation** - Essential rituals for capturing, preserving, and leveraging team knowledge with basic AI assistance
2. **The Collaborative Acceleration** - Intermediate rituals that deepen AI integration into team workflows and decision-making
3. **The Transformative Intelligence** - Advanced rituals that create breakthrough team performance through sophisticated human-AI collaboration

As an open-source project, we welcome contributions from individuals and organizations of all kinds. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or sharing your implementation experiences, your contributions are valuable to the TIP community.

## Architecture Overview

This application consists of:

* **Frontend:** A React Single-Page Application (SPA) providing the user interface.
* **Backend:** A FastAPI (Python) application providing the API, business logic, and orchestrating interactions.
* **Database:** A PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.
* **AI Server:** Integration with a local Ollama server for LLM capabilities.

## Technical Features

* Team-based accounts for collaboration.
* Management of Documents, Templates, and Process Workflows.
* In-app Markdown editor with versioning (Save, Undo/Load Previous, Redo/Load Next).
* Process Workflow execution using local Ollama models.
* Content sharing (global read-only visibility).
* Content duplication.
* Full-text search (basic implementation).
* Admin interface for team management.
* Dockerized deployment via `docker-compose`.

## Executing Backend Tests (Work in progress)

Here's how you can run all the tests:

### Navigate to the Backend Directory:

Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the root of the backend application:

```bash
cd ./ulacm_backend
```

### Ensure Dependencies are Installed:

Make sure all dependencies, including development dependencies (like pytest, pytest-asyncio, freezegun, httpx), are installed. If you haven't already, run:

```bash
poetry env use python3.11
poetry install --with dev --no-root
```

### Run Pytest:

Execute the pytest command in your terminal from the ulacm_backend directory:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

pytest will automatically discover all files named test_*.py or *_test.py and all functions prefixed with test_ within the tests directory and its subdirectories.
It will execute each test function.
You will see output indicating the progress and results (e.g., dots . for passed tests, F for failures, E for errors).
A summary will be printed at the end showing the total number of tests run, passed, failed, etc.
Example Output (Simplified):

============================= test session starts ==============================

============================== XX passed in X.XXs ===============================

If you want to repeat the tests after fixes it is a good idea to clean the caches:

```bash
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -r {} +
find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
```

## Executing Frontend Tests (Work in progress)

Here's how you can run all the tests:

### Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

Open your terminal or command prompt and change your current directory to the root of the backend application:

```bash
cd ./ulacm_frontend
```

### Ensure Dependencies are Installed:

Make sure all dependencies, including development dependencies, are installed. If you haven't already, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Base tests in watch mode

To automatically re-run tests whenever you save a file, you can run Jest in watch mode:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
# or 'npm test -- --watchAll'
# Note the extra '--' needed with npm run to pass arguments to the script
```

Watch mode is very useful as it provides instant feedback as you develop components and their corresponding tests.

Jest will output the results directly to your terminal, showing:
* Which test suites (files) passed or failed.
* How many individual tests passed or failed.
* Details about any failing tests, including error messages and code snippets.
* A test coverage summary.

### GUI Mode

Run

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

This opens the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run specific E2E tests interactively.
Make sure your frontend development server (yarn dev or npm run dev) is running first.

### Headless Mode

Run

```bash
npm run cypress:run.
```

This executes all E2E tests in a headless browser (usually Electron by default) and outputs results to the console. This is typically used in CI environments.
Your frontend server needs to be running for this as well, unless you configure Cypress to start it.

## Contribution Process
