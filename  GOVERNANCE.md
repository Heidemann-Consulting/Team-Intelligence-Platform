## Project Vision

The Team Intelligence Platform (TIP) aims to transform enterprise product development by making AI a true team member, enabling distributed cognition that amplifies collective intelligence beyond the sum of individual capabilities.

This governance model supports this vision by:
- Ensuring decisions align with the project's core mission
- Fostering inclusive community participation
- Maintaining high-quality standards
- Enabling transparent and fair processes
- Balancing innovation with stability

## Governance Principles

The TIP project is governed according to the following principles:

1. **Open Development**: All development occurs in public, with decisions and discussions visible to all
2. **Inclusive Participation**: Anyone can contribute, regardless of affiliation or background
3. **Merit-Based Recognition**: Influence is earned through consistent, quality contributions
4. **Transparent Decision Making**: Decision processes are clear, with rationales communicated openly
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Different aspects of the project may have different decision models
6. **Pragmatic Evolution**: Governance adapts to meet the project's evolving needs
7. **Sustainability**: Governance promotes long-term project health over short-term gains

## Project Structure

The TIP project operates under a multi-tiered, meritocratic governance model:

1. **Initial Stewardship**: Heidemann Consulting serves as the initial project steward
2. **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**: Strategic oversight and major decisions
3. **Maintainers**: Technical leadership for specific components
4. **Contributors**: Anyone making contributions to the project
5. **Users**: Community members using the project

The governance structure balances centralized direction with distributed decision-making:
- Strategic direction and major decisions flow through the TSC
- Day-to-day decisions are made by maintainers
- Community input is actively sought on all significant matters

## Decision-Making Process

The TIP project uses different decision-making approaches based on the scope and impact of the decision:

### Everyday Decisions

For routine matters (bug fixes, minor features, documentation improvements):
- Decisions are made directly by maintainers
- Consensus is sought among maintainers when multiple are involved
- Pull requests require approval from at least one maintainer

### Significant Technical Decisions

For changes with broader impact (API changes, major features, architecture decisions):
1. A proposal is created as a GitHub issue with the "proposal" label
2. Community discussion period of at least 7 days
3. Maintainers review feedback and seek consensus
4. Decision is made by maintainer consensus or TSC input if consensus cannot be reached
5. Decision and rationale are documented in the issue

### Strategic Decisions

For major strategic decisions (project scope, governance changes, major releases):
1. A formal RFC (Request for Comments) is created
2. Extended community discussion period of at least 14 days
3. TSC considers community input
4. Decision requires majority approval from the TSC
5. Decision and rationale are communicated to the community

### Decision-Making Standards

All decisions should:
- Align with the project's vision and goals
- Consider long-term implications
- Respect backward compatibility when possible
- Include clear documentation and communication
- Account for security and performance implications

## Technical Steering Committee

### Formation and Composition

- Initially formed with representatives from Heidemann Consulting
- Will expand to include 5-9 members as the project grows
- Members should represent diverse perspectives, expertise, and backgrounds
- Term length is one year, with staggered terms to ensure continuity

### Member Selection

- Initial TSC appointed by Heidemann Consulting
- As the project matures, new TSC members will be nominated and elected:
  - Any community member can nominate a candidate
  - Candidates should have demonstrated commitment to the project
  - Election requires majority approval from existing TSC
  - Community input is sought during the nomination process

### Responsibilities

- Meet regularly (initially monthly) to discuss project direction
- Make strategic decisions that affect the entire project
- Approve and oversee special initiatives
- Manage project resources and assets
- Appoint and remove maintainers based on merit
- Ensure the project adheres to its vision and values
- Mediate conflicts that cannot be resolved at lower levels
- Update governance processes as needed

### Decision Making

- TSC operates on a consensus-seeking model
- When consensus cannot be reached, decisions require a 2/3 majority vote
- Quorum requires at least 50% of TSC members
- Members with conflicts of interest must recuse themselves from relevant votes
- All decisions are documented and communicated to the community

## Maintainer Guidelines

### Becoming a Maintainer

- Consistently contribute high-quality code, documentation, or community support
- Demonstrate understanding of project standards and vision
- Show ability to collaborate effectively with the community
- Be nominated by an existing maintainer or TSC member
- Receive approval from the TSC

### Maintainer Responsibilities

- Review pull requests in a timely manner
- Provide constructive feedback
- Ensure all merged code meets project standards
- Help with issue triage and management
- Participate in project discussions and planning
- Support and mentor contributors
- Act as ambassadors for the project
- Uphold and enforce the Code of Conduct

### Maintainer Scope

- Maintainers may have responsibility for specific components or the entire project
- Component maintainers have authority over their assigned areas

### Maintainer Removal

- Maintainers may step down at any time
- Inactive maintainers (no contribution for 6+ months) may be removed after notification
- Maintainers who repeatedly violate the Code of Conduct or project standards may be removed by TSC decision
- Removal requires TSC approval

## Contributor Progression

TIP follows a meritocratic model where contributors can take on increasing responsibility based on their contributions and engagement:

### Progression Path

1. **First-time Contributor**: Makes initial contributions
2. **Regular Contributor**: Consistent, quality contributions over time

2. **Maintainer Mediation**: If direct resolution fails, maintainers help mediate
3. **TSC Involvement**: For conflicts that cannot be resolved by maintainers
4. **Community Discussion**: In cases where broader input would be valuable
5. **Final Decision**: TSC makes final determination when necessary

### Technical Disagreements

For technical disputes:
- Focus on objective criteria and project goals
- Consider proof-of-concept implementations when appropriate
- Use data and benchmarks when available
- Consider long-term maintenance implications
- Seek outside expert input when necessary

### Interpersonal Conflicts

For interpersonal conflicts:
- Reference the Code of Conduct for expected behavior
- Focus on specific behaviors rather than individuals
- Use private communication channels initially
- Involve Code of Conduct team when appropriate
- Document resolution process while respecting privacy

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

The Code of Conduct is essential to maintaining a healthy community:

### Enforcement Body
