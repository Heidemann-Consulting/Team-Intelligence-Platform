## Slide 9: Team Roles – Everyone Plays a Part

* **Navigator (rotating):** The day’s driver of HORIZON – kicks off workflows, feeds AI any needed info, and checks outputs. This role rotates so everyone gains skill and no one is overburdened.
* **Contributors:** All team members contribute updates – e.g., each person gives a quick status for the Daily Log or provides feedback on AI drafts. HORIZON is collaborative.
* **Metrics Steward (rotating):** Ensures key numbers (sales figures, user metrics) are up-to-date for the AI to include in reports. A small weekly duty, rotated among team analysts or leads.
* **Editor-in-Chief (rotating):** Final set of eyes for weekly/monthly outputs – polishes wording, ensures tone and quality, and helps maintain template consistency by feeding improvements back.
* *By dividing and rotating these roles, the load is light and knowledge of the system spreads across the team (no single point of failure). Plus, it’s kind of fun to take turns “driving” the AI!*

## Slide 10: Daily & Weekly Rituals – Rhythm of Execution

* **Morning Stand-up (daily, ~10 min):** Team shares what’s done & what’s next. The Navigator then has AI generate Daily Log + Plan – everyone leaves with a clear game plan by 9:30 AM.
* **Throughout the Day:** Team members update the Task Backlog as they progress. If something big happens (decision, blocker), just jot it down – it’ll flow into tomorrow’s log or weekly review.
* **Weekly Kick-off (Monday, ~20 min):** Review the AI-drafted Weekly Plan outlining goals/tasks for the week. Align on who’s doing what. This sets focus and helps resist random mid-week detours.
* **Weekly Review (Friday, ~15 min):** Quick retrospective using AI’s summary. Celebrate wins, note challenges. Team discusses any adjustments for next week while it’s fresh. Then, unplug for the weekend knowing nothing is lost.
* **Consistency is key:** These checkpoints become a heartbeat that keeps the team synchronized. The AI ensures documentation is ready at each beat, the team ensures the insights are acted on.

* **Quarterly Business Review:** At quarter’s end, a more comprehensive look. The AI-generated QBR doc surfaces overall performance, objective outcomes, and lessons. The team (and perhaps stakeholders) meet to strategize for the next quarter. This often feeds into updating the North Star Charter or setting the next OKRs – aligning strategy to reality.
* **Annual Planning:** Using QBRs and stored knowledge, the AI helps draft an annual strategic plan. In an annual retreat, leadership refines vision, sets big yearly objectives, and allocates budgets. HORIZON ensures all the rich context of the year is at their fingertips during this big-picture thinking.
* **Continuous Alignment:** These longer-term rituals prevent strategic drift. Because the AI keeps history, each review builds on real data and documented decisions. The team is always moving forward with context, not starting from scratch each quarter or year.

## Slide 12: Getting Started – Setting Up HORIZON

* **Import Templates:** Load the provided HORIZON templates into your TIP workspace. These cover all document types you’ll need.
* **Create Core Docs:** Draft your North Star Charter (mission, values, strategy) and list current quarter OKRs, backlog tasks, etc. Don’t worry about perfection – even a rough draft gives the AI something to work with.
* **Configure Workflows:** In TIP’s workflow manager, set up the HORIZON processes (Daily Log, Plan, Weekly, etc.) per instructions. It’s mostly selecting which docs go in and which come out, using the templates.
* **Assign Roles & Schedule:** Decide who will be Navigator on Day 1, who keeps an eye on metrics, etc. Put the daily stand-up and weekly meetings on everyone’s calendar with clear times.
* **Trial Run:** Do a “practice day”. For example, run the Daily Log workflow using yesterday’s info to see the output, and adjust any prompt if needed (maybe you want a different tone – tweak the template). This dry run helps the team trust the system when it goes live.
* **Onboard the Team:** Walk everyone through the process (could even use these slides!). Address concerns and emphasize that it’s okay to make adjustments – HORIZON will adapt with you.

The atmosphere radiates innovation and camaraderie, with subtle reflections of the team members' faces shimmering on the glass surface. Award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed.

## Slide 13: Best Practices for Smooth Sailing

* **Keep Info Updated:** Treat the knowledge base as living documents. A quick update today saves the AI (and everyone) from bad info tomorrow. If you close a task or decide something, log it.
* **Review AI Outputs, then Trust Them:** Always give outputs a quick sanity check, but over time you’ll find they’re mostly on point. Rely on them to avoid rework – edit a bit rather than writing from scratch.
* **Be Specific with AI Instructions:** If you need something nuanced, don’t hesitate to tweak a prompt or add a one-liner note for the AI (e.g., “Client X is very important, highlight their project in the report”). The local LLM is good, but clarity helps it shine.
* **Timebox and Iterate:** Set a limit (say 5 min) for editing an AI-generated doc. If it’s not perfect by then, save it and move on – you can refine in the next cycle. It’s better to have a “good enough” version now than a perfect version too late.
* **Continuously Improve:** Make the Prompt Workshop a regular habit (bi-weekly or monthly). Little tweaks to templates or workflows (like adding an example, or a new rule) can gradually boost quality and team satisfaction. It’s like sharpening the axe.
* **Stay Open to Feedback:** Encourage team members to speak up if something feels off – maybe a workflow is too frequent or a template section isn’t useful. HORIZON is flexible; you can turn knobs to suit your unique team culture.
  *Image Prompt:* Ultra High Resolution photo of a modern workspace featuring a sleek, minimalist office with floor-to-ceiling glass walls bathed in bright natural light from large windows.

Award-winning, epic composition, ultra detailed.

## Slide 14: FAQ – Making HORIZON Yours

* **“What if the AI says something wrong?”** – Built-in human oversight means you’ll catch it. Fix the output and refine the prompt if needed. Over time, these cases dwindle. The system learns from corrections.
* **“Can we modify the templates?”** – Absolutely! They’re a starting point. Add your company’s sections (e.g., a safety tip of the day), or change wording to fit your lingo. Just keep the structure clear for the AI.
* **“Do we have to use every part of HORIZON?”** – Not at all. Start with the pieces that solve your biggest pain. Maybe that’s just daily planning and weekly recaps. You can always add the rest later once you’re comfortable.
* **“Is our data safe?”** – Yes, everything runs locally in your environment. The AI isn’t calling external APIs. Plus, TIP’s versioning means you have an audit trail of changes.
* **“What if we already use Tool X?”** – HORIZON can complement existing tools. For instance, if you use JIRA for tasks, you might still use HORIZON for higher-level planning and let the AI read summaries from JIRA exports. It’s flexible – integrate where it makes sense, but many teams find they rely less on other tools as HORIZON covers their needs in one place.
* In short: **make it work for you.** HORIZON is a framework, not a rigid mandate. Experiment and tailor it to amplify your team’s strengths and workflows.
