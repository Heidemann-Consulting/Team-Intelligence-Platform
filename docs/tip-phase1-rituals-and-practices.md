## **1. Executive Summary**

This document details the core team rituals and practices for Phase 1 of the Team Intelligence Platform (TIP), "The Cognitive Foundation," adapted for use **within the TIP application**. It provides a practical playbook for implementing the foundational processes necessary for AI Co-Management, focusing on how teams can capture, preserve, and leverage knowledge with basic AI assistance **using TIP's document management and workflow capabilities.**

Phase 1 introduces three core rituals, reframed for the TIP environment:

1.  **Context Curation Ritual (TIP):** Daily (15 min) and weekly (30 min) sessions using **TIP Documents** and its versioning. The team collaborates to build a shared team knowledge base within TIP. LLM calls for summarization will be performed by manually triggering a TIP Process Workflow (e.g., "SummarizeTextWorkflow") on selected documents, as direct LLM tool access is not available.
2.  **Prompt Development Workshop (TIP):** Bi-weekly (45 min) collaborative sessions using **TIP Documents** to create and refine effective team-specific AI prompts. These prompts will be used within **TIP Process Workflows**. Testing is done by running these workflows.
3.  **AI-Assisted Documentation (TIP):** Integrating AI (via **TIP Process Workflows** like "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow") into existing meeting workflows (using **TIP Documents**) to improve documentation quality and efficiency (10-15 min post-meeting).

Implementing these practices aims to deliver significant benefits within 4-6 weeks, including reduced information search time (30-40%), shorter meeting times (25-30%), improved documentation quality (50%), and faster onboarding (40%), establishing the base for more advanced AI collaboration within TIP.

## **2. Core Principles of AI Co-Management (Phase 1 Focus for TIP)**

Phase 1 practices in TIP embody these core principles in a foundational way:

1.  **Collective Context:** Prioritize building a shared, explicit team knowledge base (as **TIP Documents with consistent naming**) over relying on individual, implicit context when interacting with AI.
2.  **Explicit AI Roles:** Assign basic, clear roles to AI within rituals (e.g., "Summarizer" in Documentation, "Assistant" in Curation) with defined tasks, executed via **TIP Process Workflows**.
3.  **Integration into Ceremonies:** Structure AI use within defined rituals (Curation, Prompt Dev) and integrate AI assistance into existing processes (Meeting Documentation) using **TIP Documents and Workflows**.
4.  **Transparent Collective Evaluation:** Implement team review of AI outputs (e.g., summaries generated by TIP Workflows, curated context in TIP Documents) against shared expectations during rituals.
5.  **Continuous Learning:** Establish feedback loops (Prompt Workshop, Curation Review) to iteratively improve prompts (for TIP Workflows) and knowledge organization (within TIP Documents).
6.  **Balance of Autonomy and Oversight:** Start with high human oversight (reviewing all AI-generated TIP Documents), granting minimal autonomy in specific, well-defined tasks (e.g., initial summary generation via a TIP Workflow).

## **3. Phase 1 Overview: The Cognitive Foundation in TIP**

Phase 1 focuses on establishing the essential practices and habits for AI Co-Management **using the Team Intelligence Platform.**

* **Focus:** Practices for knowledge capture, basic AI interaction, and documentation enhancement **within TIP**.
* **Duration:** 4-6 weeks to establish core habits.
* **Prerequisites:** Team commitment, access to TIP, and familiarity with its Document and Process Workflow functionalities. LLMs are locally hosted and accessed via TIP workflows, with no direct internet or tool access by the LLM itself.
* **Key Outcomes:** Functioning team knowledge repository (as TIP Documents), initial library of effective prompts (for TIP Workflows), consistent AI-assisted documentation process (using TIP Workflows), measurable initial benefits.
* **Time Investment:** Approx. 1.5-2 hours per team member per week dedicated to rituals, plus post-meeting documentation time using TIP.
* **Expected Benefits:** (Targets) 30-40% less search time, 25-30% less meeting time, 50% better documentation quality, 40% faster onboarding.

## **4. Core Rituals in Detail (TIP Workflow)**

### **4.1 Context Curation Ritual in TIP**

* **Purpose:** Systematically capture, organize, and maintain the team's collective knowledge accessible to humans and AI **within TIP Documents**.
* **Format:**
    * Daily Quick Capture: 15 min standup-style session.
    * Weekly Structured Review: 30 min comprehensive review and health check.
* **Participants:** All team members, Facilitator (rotating), AI (via **TIP Process Workflow** e.g., "SummarizeContextWorkflow").
* **Process:**
    1.  **Daily (15 min):** Each member shares 1 key context item. The Facilitator creates a new **TIP Document** using the "Daily_Context_Curation_Template" (from the [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md)). The name should be consistent, e.g., "DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD".
        * (Optional) The facilitator can copy relevant text from the daily capture document and run the "SummarizeTextWorkflow" to generate a summary, then paste this summary back into the daily capture document.
        * Team clarifies. The Facilitator saves the **TIP Document**, creating a new version.
    2.  **Weekly (30 min):** Review captured **TIP Documents** (e.g., daily logs, meeting summaries) from the past week. Add missing context to relevant documents or create new ones. Assess context health (gaps, staleness) by creating and filling out a new **TIP Document** using the "Weekly_Context_Curation_Template" (e.g., named "WeeklyContextReview_YYYY-MM-DD_WeekNumber"). Prioritize gaps. All created/updated documents are saved in TIP.
* **Tools:** **Team Intelligence Platform (TIP)** for document creation, editing, versioning, and executing AI workflows.
* **Artifacts:**
    * An evolving knowledge repository as consistently named **TIP Documents** (e.g., `Context_ProjectAlpha_Goals`, `Decision_Log_FeatureX`).
    * Daily and Weekly Curation logs as **TIP Documents** (e.g., `DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD`, `WeeklyContextReview_YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * Context health insights documented in the Weekly Review documents.
* **Success Indicators:** Consistent growth of well-named **TIP Documents**, reduced repetitive questions, faster onboarding, team references TIP documents.
* **Common Challenges:** Inconsistent participation (solution: calendar blocking, value demo), low-quality input (solution: clear instructions on using templates, examples), disorganized documents (solution: strict naming conventions, weekly review), time creep (solution: strict timeboxing).

### **4.2 Prompt Development Workshop in TIP**

* **Purpose:** Collaboratively develop, test, and refine team prompts for **TIP Process Workflows**, encoding team processes and knowledge.
* **Format:** Bi-weekly 45 min workshop.
* **Participants:** Core team members, Facilitator, AI (prompts tested by executing **TIP Process Workflows**). Optional: Prompt expert.
* **Process:**
    1.  **Prep (Async):** Identify a workflow/task needing a new or improved prompt. Document the current prompt (if any) and issues, or the goal of the new prompt, in a **TIP Document** using the "Prompt_Workshop_Preparation_Template" (e.g., named `PromptPrep_SummarizeMeeting_YYYY-MM-DD`). Gather examples of inputs and desired outputs.
    2.  **Workshop (45 min):**
        * Review current performance or goals (10 min).
        * Collaboratively draft/refine the prompt text within a shared **TIP Document** (e.g., `PromptDevelopment_SummarizeMeeting_Draft_V1`). (20 min)
        * To test, an Administrator updates the relevant **TIP Process Workflow** (e.g., "SummarizeMeetingWorkflow") with the new prompt. The team then executes this workflow with sample input documents to observe the output. (10 min)
        * Document the final prompt, input document selection criteria, and output expectations in a **TIP Document** using the "Prompt_Documentation_Template" (e.g., named `PromptDoc_SummarizeMeeting_V1`). Save the document. (5 min)
    3.  **Follow-up (Async):** The documented prompt is now part of the team's knowledge base in TIP. If a new Process Workflow is needed, an Admin creates it based on this documentation.
* **Tools:** **Team Intelligence Platform (TIP)** for document drafting, documentation, and executing Process Workflows to test prompts.
* **Artifacts:** A growing library of documented prompts stored as **TIP Documents** (e.g., `PromptDoc_SummarizeMeeting_V1`, `PromptDoc_ExtractRequirements_V1`).
* **Success Indicators:** Improved output quality from **TIP Process Workflows**, team adoption of standard prompts (documented in TIP), reduced time on ad-hoc prompting, reusable prompt patterns emerge.
* **Common Challenges:** LLM limitations (solution: model choice by Admin, expectation setting), inconsistent results (solution: systematic testing via TIP workflows, refinement), over-engineering (solution: focus on outcome, simplicity), version confusion (solution: clear document naming and versioning in TIP for prompt documentation).

### **4.3 AI-Assisted Documentation Ritual in TIP**

* **Purpose:** Enhance quality, consistency, and accessibility of team documentation (especially meetings) using **TIP Process Workflows**.
* **Format:** Integrated into existing meeting workflow; 10-15 min post-meeting processing **within TIP**.
* **Participants:** Meeting Facilitator/Scribe, Meeting Participants, AI (via **TIP Process Workflow** e.g., "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow").
* **Process:**
    1.  **During Meeting:** Capture raw notes in a **TIP Document** using the "Meeting_Notes_Template" (e.g., named `MeetingNotes_ProjectAlpha_Standup_YYYY-MM-DD`). Include `#decision` and `#action` tags as plain text markers.
    2.  **Post-Meeting (10-15 min):**
        * The Facilitator finalizes the raw meeting notes **TIP Document**.
        * The Facilitator then initiates the "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow". This workflow is designed to take a source document (the meeting notes) as input.
        * The workflow processes the notes (using its configured LLM prompt, which might instruct the AI to look for `#decision` and `#action` markers) and generates a new **TIP Document** containing the structured summary. The output document will be named according to the workflow's output naming template (e.g., `MeetingSummary_ProjectAlpha_Standup_YYYY-MM-DD_AI-Generated`).
        * The Facilitator reviews and refines the AI-generated summary **TIP Document**. The content should ideally follow the "AI_Generated_Summary_Template" structure.
        * The Facilitator saves the refined summary document in TIP.
* **Tools:** **Team Intelligence Platform (TIP)** for creating meeting notes documents, executing the "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow", and storing/refining the AI-generated summary document.
* **Artifacts:**
    * Consistent, structured meeting summaries as **TIP Documents** (e.g., `MeetingSummary_ProjectAlpha_Standup_YYYY-MM-DD_AI-Generated`), with decisions & actions.
    * Raw meeting notes also stored as **TIP Documents**.
* **Success Indicators:** All key meetings documented consistently in TIP, improved summary quality/completeness, faster post-meeting processing time, better decision traceability through linked TIP documents (manually linked if needed, or by consistent naming).
* **Common Challenges:** Inconsistent note-taking (solution: scribe role, template enforcement in TIP), poor summary quality from workflow (solution: Prompt Development Workshops to refine the prompt used in "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow", human review), lost context (solution: ensure meeting notes document has sufficient detail, reference other TIP document names in notes), action tracking disconnect (solution: clear formatting in summary, manual transfer to task systems if not integrated).
    * **News Research Adaptation:** If the ritual involved internet-based news research, this step must now be manual. A team member conducts the research using standard web search, then synthesizes the findings into a **new TIP Document**. This document should be named clearly (e.g., `NewsDigest_TopicX_YYYY-MM-DD`) and can then be used as input for other rituals or workflows.

## **5. Implementation Playbook (Ritual Focus within TIP)**

*(Assumes technical setup of TIP is complete and users are onboarded)*

### **5.1 Week 1: Foundation & TIP Familiarization**

* **Goal:** Understand TIP's document structure, versioning, and basic Process Workflow execution. Start basic knowledge capture in TIP.
* **Activities:**
    * Team walkthrough of TIP: Creating, naming, editing, and saving documents. Understanding how versions are created. Viewing version history.
    * Introduction to available Document Templates (e.g., "Daily_Context_Curation_Template") and how to use them to create new documents.
    * Introduction to pre-configured Process Workflows (e.g., "SummarizeTextWorkflow") and how to execute them.
    * Individual practice: Create first few context notes as **TIP Documents** (e.g., `MyContext_TopicA_Initials_YYYY-MM-DD`). Practice basic interaction by running a simple workflow on a test document.
    * Team session: Define initial core context areas to document in TIP (e.g., `ProjectAlpha_Goals`, `Team_KeyTerms`, `Team_Roles_Responsibilities`).
    * Assign initial facilitator roles for rituals.
    * Establish baseline metrics (Sec 7.3).

### **5.2 Week 2: First Rituals Implementation in TIP**

* **Goal:** Start executing Context Curation and AI-Assisted Documentation rituals **using TIP**.
* **Activities:**
    * Conduct first Daily Context Curation sessions. Facilitator creates the `DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD` document using the template. Focus on habit, not perfection. Save the document.
    * Implement AI-Assisted Documentation for one recurring meeting type. Scribe creates the `MeetingNotes_MeetingName_YYYY-MM-DD` document. Post-meeting, run the "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow" and save the output and refined summary as new TIP documents.
    * Team review: Discuss initial experiences, TIP usability, template clarity. Make minor adjustments to internal processes.

### **5.3 Week 3: Habit Formation in TIP**

* **Goal:** Build consistency in daily/weekly rituals, introduce Prompt Development **using TIP workflows and documents**.
* **Activities:**
    * Continue Daily Context Curation and AI-Assisted Documentation in TIP. Focus on improving quality of contributions and generated summaries.
    * Conduct first Weekly Structured Review. Create and fill the `WeeklyContextReview_YYYY-MM-DD_WeekNumber` document using the template.
    * Conduct first Prompt Development Workshop. Focus on one simple, high-value prompt (e.g., for meeting summaries). Document the preparation and outcome in respective TIP documents. Test prompts by having an Admin update a test Process Workflow in TIP.
    * Encourage individual exploration of how existing prompts in workflows perform via TIP.

### **5.4 Week 4: Stabilization and Assessment in TIP**

* **Goal:** Refine processes within TIP, measure initial impact, plan continuation.
* **Activities:**
    * Continue all three core rituals with increasing team fluency in TIP. Rotate facilitator roles.
    * Refine Document Templates (if admin configurable) and prompts (documented in TIP, implemented in workflows by Admin) based on feedback and experience.
    * Conduct comprehensive review session:
        * Assess progress against baseline metrics (Sec 7.3).
        * Gather qualitative team feedback on using TIP for these rituals (what worked, what didn't).
        * Identify areas for continuous improvement (Sec 8).
        * Assess readiness for potential Phase 2 progression.

## **6. Adoption Strategies (for TIP Users)**

### **6.1 Adoption by Team Type**
* **Small Teams (5-9):** Implement all rituals using shared TIP documents. Rotate facilitation. Focus on high participation and quick feedback within TIP. Adapt document templates to be lightweight. (Timeline: 3-4 weeks)
* **Project Teams (10-15):** Designate facilitators for TIP-based rituals. Integrate with existing ceremonies (e.g., daily curation document linked after standup). Align TIP document naming with project artifacts. Measure impact on project outcomes documented in TIP. (Timeline: 4-6 weeks)
* **Enterprise Programs (Multiple Teams):** Start with 1-2 pilot teams using TIP. Provide centralized support/guidance for TIP usage. Establish standard TIP document templates and Process Workflows. Build a community of practice around TIP. (Timeline: 6-8 weeks pilot, then phased expansion)

### **6.2 Adoption Personas and Engagement**
* **AI Enthusiast:** Channel energy into leading prompt development for TIP Workflows, coaching on TIP usage, exploring advanced TIP workflow capabilities relevant to rituals. Focus on team benefit over individual use.
* **Practical Pragmatist:** Emphasize time savings from streamlined documentation in TIP, efficiency gains from workflows, improved documentation quality. Show metrics. Involve in process optimization within TIP and ROI tracking.
* **Skeptical Professional:** Position TIP workflows as assistants requiring human review. Start with low-risk documentation tasks (e.g., using "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow" and then editing). Emphasize AI's role in capturing *their* expertise accurately in TIP documents. Involve in quality review of AI-generated TIP documents.
* **Overwhelmed Adopter:** Start with passive participation in TIP-based rituals. Focus on one ritual first (e.g., contributing context to a daily TIP document). Provide clear, simple guides for using TIP. Highlight immediate personal benefits (less searching in TIP).

### **6.3 Common Adoption Challenges and Solutions**
* **Inconsistent Participation:** Integrate TIP ritual document creation into calendar, clearly demo value of TIP knowledge base, get leadership buy-in for TIP usage, keep rituals concise.
* **Poor Knowledge Quality in TIP Documents:** Use pre-defined Document Templates in TIP, provide examples, conduct peer review during Weekly Curation of TIP documents, rotate curator role.
* **TIP Usage Friction:** Provide clear workflow guides for TIP, use consistent naming conventions for TIP documents, focus on core TIP functionality first.
* **AI Output Disappointment from TIP Workflows:** Set realistic expectations, run Prompt Workshops to refine prompts for TIP workflows, ensure human review step for AI-generated TIP documents.
* **Reverting Under Pressure:** Keep TIP-based rituals short, demonstrate time savings elsewhere, assign ritual champions for TIP, leadership reinforcement of TIP usage.
* **Measurement Difficulty:** Start simple (Sec 7.3), use qualitative feedback, connect to existing team pain points that TIP can help solve.

## **7. Measurement Framework (Practice-Oriented for TIP)**

### **7.1 Measurement Principles**

1. **Start Simple:** Focus on a few key, easy-to-track metrics initially.
2. **Balance Quant/Qual:** Combine metrics with team feedback and observations.
3. **Focus on Team Outcomes:** Prioritize metrics reflecting collective improvement.
4. **Transparent & Participatory:** Involve the team, make results visible, use for learning.
5. **Connect to Goals:** Link metrics to Phase 1 objectives and team pain points.

### **7.2 Phase 1 Ritual \& Practice Metrics**
* **Ritual Adherence:**
    * % of scheduled rituals completed (tracked by creation of corresponding TIP documents, e.g., `DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * % of team members actively contributing to/editing relevant TIP documents per ritual.
* **Knowledge Management Practice (in TIP):**
    * Knowledge repository growth rate (\# new TIP documents created/week).
    * Knowledge contribution distribution (% team creating/editing TIP documents).
    * Frequency of TIP document access/reference (qualitative observation or survey, or if TIP has analytics).
    * Context quality rating (team assessment of TIP documents during Weekly Review).
* **Documentation Practice (in TIP):**
    * % of key meetings with AI-assisted summaries created as TIP documents.
    * Time spent on post-meeting documentation (compare before/after TIP workflow usage).
    * Documentation quality rating of TIP documents (team assessment/rubric).
* **Prompt Practice (for TIP Workflows):**
    * Number of documented prompts (as TIP Documents).
    * Frequency of TIP Process Workflow usage that rely on these prompts (qualitative or if TIP has analytics).
    * Perceived effectiveness rating of TIP Workflows (team feedback).
* **Efficiency Gains (Proxy):**
    * Team perception of time saved searching for info (in TIP) (survey).
    * Meeting duration trends (track time).

### **7.3 Measurement Implementation Guide**
1.  **Baseline (Week 1):**
    * Estimate current time spent searching for info.
    * Measure current meeting durations for key recurring meetings.
    * Estimate current post-meeting documentation time.
    * Assess current documentation quality (simple team rating 1-5).
    * Count existing shared prompts (if any, even outside TIP).
2.  **Tracking (Weekly):**
    * Log ritual completion by checking for the existence of the relevant **TIP Documents** (e.g., the `DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD` document).
    * Track number of new TIP documents added to the system.
    * Track number of meeting summary documents created in TIP.
    * Facilitator notes on participation levels.
3.  **Review (Weekly/Monthly):**
    * Discuss metrics during Weekly Review or dedicated monthly session, referencing TIP documents.
    * Collect qualitative feedback on ritual effectiveness and perceived benefits of using TIP.
    * Update simple dashboard/tracker visible to the team (could be a TIP document).
4.  **Assessment (End of Phase 1 \- Week 4/6):**
    * Compare current metrics against baseline.
    * Conduct final team survey on perceived changes (search time in TIP, doc quality in TIP, etc.).
    * Summarize quantitative and qualitative findings (possibly in a TIP document).

## **8. Continuous Improvement of Practices within TIP**

### **8.1 Learning Feedback Loops**

* **Quick Loop (End of Ritual):** Brief \+/-/delta discussion (2 min). What worked well? What could be smoother next time? Facilitator notes immediate adjustments.
* **Monthly Loop (Dedicated Session):** Review metrics trends, discuss patterns, analyze effectiveness of templates/prompts, plan more significant process adjustments based on data and feedback.

### **8.2 Phase 1 Improvement Focus**
* **Ritual Execution:** Consistency, timing, facilitation effectiveness, participation quality using TIP.
* **TIP Usage:** Ease of use for core tasks (document creation/editing, workflow execution, version navigation).
* **Knowledge Organization in TIP:** Clarity of document naming conventions, ease of finding information using TIP search. Effectiveness of Document Templates.
* **Prompt Effectiveness for TIP Workflows:** Clarity, reliability, usefulness of standard prompts used in TIP Process Workflows.

### **8.3 Practice Innovation Mechanisms**

* **Ritual Retrospectives:** Use the Monthly Learning Loop to explicitly ask "How can we improve this ritual?"
* **Prompt Workshop:** Dedicate part of the workshop to experimenting with new prompt structures or techniques.
* **"Kaizen" Corner:** Maintain a simple list (e.g., Obsidian note) where team members can suggest small improvements to rituals or tool usage anytime. Review during Weekly/Monthly loops.

## **9. Progression to Phase 2 (Readiness Criteria for TIP Users)**

Consider advancing beyond Phase 1 practices when the team demonstrates:

1.  **Solid Knowledge Foundation in TIP:** The TIP document repository is actively used, consistently updated with well-named documents, well-organized, and contains core team knowledge.
2.  **Established Team Proficiency with TIP:** Rituals run smoothly with minimal prompting, team members are comfortable with TIP's document management, versioning, and executing basic Process Workflows. The prompt library (as TIP documents) is actively used and evolving.
3.  **Realized Benefits:** Measurable improvements in efficiency (search time in TIP, meeting time) and quality (documentation in TIP) are evident and acknowledged by the team.
4.  **Stable Technical Base:** TIP is reliably deployed and accessible, core Process Workflows are functioning smoothly.

**Readiness Assessment:** Conduct a formal review against these criteria, incorporating metrics and team feedback, before planning Phase 2 implementation.

## **10. Appendices**

### **10.1 TIP Ritual Templates Library Reference**

All templates referenced in this document are defined in the [**`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`**](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md) document. Users should refer to this library when creating new documents in TIP for the specified rituals. For example, when starting the "Daily Quick Capture", create a new TIP document using the content from the "Daily Quick Capture Template" in the library. Give the document a consistent name, such as `DailyContextCuration_YYYY-MM-DD`.

Available templates include:
* **Daily Quick Capture Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md))
* **Weekly Structured Review Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md))
* **Prompt Workshop Preparation Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md))
* **Prompt Documentation Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md))
* **Meeting Notes Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md))
* **AI-Generated Summary Template** (from [`tip-phase1-templates-library.md`](./tip-phase1-templates-library.md) - this describes the *structure* of the AI output)

### **10.2 TIP Workflow Library Reference**

The Process Workflows referenced throughout this document (e.g., "SummarizeTextWorkflow", "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow") are examples that can be found detailed in the [**`tip-phase1-workflow-library.md`**](./tip-phase1-workflow-library.md) document. Administrators should refer to this library for definitions and guidance when creating or configuring these Process Workflows within TIP.

### **10.3 Facilitation Guides (High-Level for TIP)**

* **Daily Curation:** Prepare by knowing which template to use in TIP ("Daily_Context_Curation_Template"). Start on time. Round-robin sharing (1 item each). Facilitator captures in the new TIP document. Optionally, use "SummarizeTextWorkflow" on parts of the document. Clarify. Save document in TIP. End on time.
* **Weekly Review:** Prepare by knowing which template to use ("Weekly_Context_Curation_Template"). Review past week's TIP documents. Assess health (gaps, usage). Discuss & prioritize improvements. Capture actions in the TIP document. Save document in TIP. End on time.
* **Prompt Workshop:** Review prep docs (TIP documents). Discuss current state. Collaborative drafting in a new TIP document. Test by having an Admin update a Process Workflow in TIP and executing it. Document outcome in a TIP document ("Prompt_Documentation_Template"). Assign follow-ups. End on time.
* **AI-Assisted Documentation:** Ensure scribe captures notes in a TIP document using "Meeting_Notes_Template". Post-meeting: Facilitator ensures notes document is saved. Initiates "GenerateMeetingSummaryWorkflow", selecting the notes document as input. Review/Edit the AI-generated TIP document. Save final summary document in TIP.

*(Detailed step-by-step guides for using TIP for each ritual could be developed as separate documents within TIP itself, e.g., `UserGuide_DailyCurationRitual_TIP`.)*

### **10.4 Measurement Framework Details**

*(Could include specific survey questions, rubric examples for documentation quality in TIP, detailed dashboard layouts (if TIP supports dashboards, otherwise a shared metrics TIP document) - expand based on initial implementation)*
